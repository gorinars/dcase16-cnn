# CNN based DCASE 2016 sound event detection system 

Sound event detection system submitted to [DCASE 2016](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/task-sound-event-detection-in-real-life-audio) (detection and classification of acoustic scenes and events) challenge. 

Convolutional neural network is used for detecting and classifying polyphonic events in a long temporal context of filter bank acoustic features. Training data are augmented via sox speed perturbation.

On development data set the system achieves 0.84% segment error rate (7.7% relative imporment compared to baseline) 36.3% F-measure (55.1 relative better than baseline system). 

Technical details are descibed in the [challenge report](https://dcase.community/documents/challenge2016/technical_reports/DCASE2016_Gorin_3012.pdf). Detailed results summary on development and evaluation audios are also [available](https://dcase.community/challenge2016/task-sound-event-detection-in-real-life-audio-results):
